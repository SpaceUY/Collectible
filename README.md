# Magic NFT Starter Pack 

Welcome to the Magic NFT Starter Pack!

[Magic](https://magic.link) makes it super simple to spin up secure, non-custodial wallets for users while also supporting third party wallets. This NFT Starter Pack illustrates how to integrate [Magic Connect](https://magic.link/connect) with a basic NFT site that allows users to mint and view NFTs from a particular NFT collection.

You can use both the [frontend](./frontend/) and the [contract](./contract/) directories of this repositories as templates for creating your own NFT project.

Our [Frontend Guide](./frontend/README.md) walks through the basics of the site, the Magic SDK, and interacting with the blockchain from a client.

A similar guide will be released soon detailing how to set up an on-chain contract for an NFT project.
