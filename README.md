# Magic NFT Starter Pack 

Welcome to the Magic NFT Starter Pack!

[Magic](https://magic.link) makes it super simple to provide users with secure, non-custodial wallets while also supporting third party wallets. This NFT Starter Pack illustrates how to integrate [Magic Connect](https://magic.link/connect) with a basic NFT site that allows users to mint and view NFTs from a particular NFT collection.

## New to Magic and/or Web3?

Check out the [**Frontend Guide**](./frontend/README.md)! It walks through the basics of the site, the Magic SDK, and interacting with the blockchain from a client.

A similar guide will be released soon detailing how to set up an on-chain contract for an NFT project.

## Already know what you're doing?

Dive right into the [frontend](./frontend/) and/or [contract](./contract/) directories and use them as a starting point for creating your own NFT project with Magic.
